# Quick Start

## Installing Unity
The Rude Level Editor is a [Unity](https://unity.com) project which is a modified version of the project Ultrakill was created on. The project contains many [prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html), and [scripts](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html) which allow you to create a custom level without having much programming knowledge.

To install unity go to [the Official Unity Download](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.4.40), keep in mind we are download a slightly older version of unity, as Ultrakill runs on `Unity 2019.4.40.f1 (LTS)`.

?> **Tip!** You can download Unity Hub [here](https://unity.com/download) to manage multiple unity versions and have a better interface when opening projects. 

*Unity's official guide to installing unity is located [here](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor)!* **Make sure to download the correct version!**

## Installing Rude Level Editor

Installing the Rude Level Editor is similar to installing any unity project.

Once you arrive in the Rude Discord Server, you will only be able to see the `#rude-gates` channel. Once `@eternalUnion` has given you access to the google drive link download the file.

Then, extract the zip, and import the project into unity. Go to the projects tab and click the small triangle next to `Open`.

Then click `Add project from disk` and locate the project you have just extracted.

?> **Tip!** It's usually good practice to not leave your Unity projects in your download folder. Create a new folder in your disk and move your project there. **(DO THIS BEFORE DOING THE STEP ABOVE!)**
